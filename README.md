## Greetings, I'm Rohan👋 - Cyber Analyst and Researcher 

<p align="justify">
Security is not about control, it’s about wisdom.
It lives at the intersection of logic, ethics, and entropy, where defense becomes a discipline, not just a job.
Every system tells a story of its creators, its flaws, and its assumptions, and my work is to understand those stories before someone else rewrites them.
